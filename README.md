# Basic C++ CI/CD Example

## libraries used
- [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog) for a moderm log system. (as submodule)
- [catch](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch) as the test framework.  (as submodule)

##  project structure

| folder       | Content              |
| ------------ | -------------------- |
| [/lib](/lib) | library |
| [/lib/src](/lib/src) | library sources  |
| [/lib/include](/lib/include) | library includes |
| [/lib/test](/lib/test) | library test |
| [/app](/app) | application |
| [/app/src](/app/src) | application sources  |
| [/app/test](/app/test) | application test |
| [/third-party](/third-party) | third party software        |

## generate project

```shell
  cmake -H. -BBuild
```

Auto detect everything.

If you like to set a implicit compiler set the variable CXX=${COMPILER}, for example COMPILER could be gcc, clang and so on.

Auto detect in Windows usually generate a Visual Studio project since msbuild require it, but in OSX does not generate and XCode project, since is not required for compiling using XCode clang.

Specify build type debug/release

```shell
  # generate a debug project
  cmake -H. -BBuild -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
  # generate a release project
  cmake -H. -BBuild -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```

Specify architecture

```shell
  # 64 bits architecture
  cmake -H. -BBuild -Ax64
  # ARM architecture
  cmake -H. -BBuild -AARM
  # Windows 32 bits architecture
  cmake -H. -BBuild -AxWin32
```

Generate different project types

```shell
  # MinGW makefiles
  cmake -H. -BBuild -G "MinGW Makefiles"
  # XCode project
  cmake -H. -BBuild -G "XCode"
  # Visual Studio 15 2017 solution
  cmake -H. -BBuild -G "Visual Studio 15 2017"
```

## build

From the Build folder

```shell
  # build the default build type (in multi build types usually debug)
  cmake --build .
  # build a specific build type
  cmake --build . --config Release
```
## Run tests

From the Build folder

```shell
  # run all test using the default build type
  ctest -V
  # run all test in Release build type
  ctest -V -C Release
```

## todo

- Setup docker build scripts
- Setup docker-compose
- Make docker-compose production ready (multi stage build, volumes, )
- Setup VSC to invoke docker build scripts
- Create CMake install and invoke that inside docker
- Create CMake test etc.: everything that is required for a development and production ready environment
- Cleanup docker build and apply best practice
- Create a configuration file
- Setup generic build script using python
- Setup CI for Linux
- Setup CI for Windows
- Setup CI with docker on Linux and Windows
- Setup CD using docker
- Setup Kubernetes
